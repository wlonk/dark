[ ] Add slug paths
[ ] Add per-user paths

[ ] Add disguise tracker

    [ ] Grey more than checkbox (perhaps also allow more clickable area?)
    [ ] Blue the disabled checkboxes on attributes (More likely: swap disabled

    [ ] Make suit boxes flow correctly (all above the fold if possible)

[ ] Add user profile pages
