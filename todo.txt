[ ] Add disguise tracker
[ ] Add wound tracker
[ ] Add notes section on sheet
[ ] Turn "look" into a text area

[ ] Improve styling:
    [ ] Grey more than checkbox (perhaps also allow more clickable area?)
    [ ] Blue the disabled checkboxes on attributes (More likely: swap disabled
        logic on face card abilities, so you need to check the box to enable
        text.)
    [ ] Faded red for red suits?
    [ ] Make suit boxes flow correctly (all above the fold if possible)

[ ] Paginate endpoints and UI.
