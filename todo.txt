[ ] Add disguise tracker
[ ] Add wound tracker
[ ] Improve styling:
    [ ] Grey more than checkbox (perhaps also allow more clickable area?)
    [ ] Blue the disabled checkboxes on attributes (More likely: swap disabled logic on face card abilities, so you need to check the box to enable text.)
    [ ] Faded red for red suits?
    [ ] Make suit boxes flow correctly (all above the fold if possible)
