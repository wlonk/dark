[ ] Add disguise tracker
[ ] Add wound tracker
[ ] Add face card power and augments model
[ ] Add notes section on sheet
[ ] Turn "look" into a text area

[ ] Improve styling:
    [ ] Grey more than checkbox (perhaps also allow more clickable area?)
    [ ] Blue the disabled checkboxes on attributes (More likely: swap disabled
        logic on face card abilities, so you need to check the box to enable
        text.)
    [ ] Faded red for red suits?
    [ ] Make suit boxes flow correctly (all above the fold if possible)
        To do this, make two columns, each of which has a single full-width
        thing in it; move to next column after displaying half of the Suits?
    [ ] Make pagination non-ugly
    [ ] Push more logic to backend to speed up display

[ ] Account management
    [ ] Create account
    [ ] Edit account details
    [ ] Delete account
[ ] Add Twitter OAuth
[ ] Add backend integrity checks?
